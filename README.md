# ArtificialNeuralNetwork_Challenge1

We classify plants (like the ones in the example image below) that are divided into two categories according to their state of health. It is a binary classification problem, so the goal is to predict the correct class label in {0, 1}. We used Convolutional Neural Networks and transfer learning in tensorflow and keras.
